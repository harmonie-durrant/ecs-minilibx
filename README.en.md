## ECS - Entity Component System

ECS is a programming model that allows you to separate data from behavior. In an ECS system, entities are objects that can be composed of multiple components. Components are data that describe the properties of entities. Systems are functions that act on entities based on their components.

My ECS is based on Unity's entity system. Unity is a popular game engine. It is designed to be simple and easy to use.
